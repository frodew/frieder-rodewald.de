# This is my website

I built an initial version of this website in summer 2023 before applying to my graduate program at the University of Mannheim. I wanted to play around with vue.js which had also used in another project. And I wanted to create a website where the main feature was a stacked graph (did you spot it?). I still like the idea, although people tell me that don't really recognize it but mostly see nice colors which is also fine to me.

Anyways, the [first version](https://github.com/frodew/personal_website_old) was not too responsive because it was relying on an actual svg of a stacked graph that I had created in R. So I recrected that current version with the help of AI in autumn 2025 and here we are; I now have a maintainable version running with astro, vue.js, tailwindcss, and vanilla js where I can actually add new content. Let's see how that goes :D
