I am a PhD-student of Social Data Science at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/keusch/team/academic-staff-members/rodewald-frieder/). I study what people do online, especially how they deal with their privacy and how to measure and explain their behavior. I have a background in social policy and labor studies; and I maintain a [blog](https://blog.frieder-rodewald.de/) btw :)
