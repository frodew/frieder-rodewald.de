As a graduate student, I'm advancing my quantitative skillset and getting aquainted with areas in SEM and LCA. I obtained a Master's in Labour Studies and Social Policy from the University of Bremen and the Universit√† degli Studi di Milano Statale. Coming from a political science background, I have already received a wide range of training from qualitative methods to text-as-data approaches.
