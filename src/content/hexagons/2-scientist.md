I work with [Florian Keusch](https://floriankeusch.weebly.com/) in a project on the integration of data donations in survey infrastructures, funded by a [DFG Infrastructure Priority Programme](https://www.new-data-spaces.de/de-de/). As a researcher, I have already presented my work on "The Meaning of Care in Parliamentary Debates" at the Transforming Care Conference and am currently preparing a publication based on the feedback. I also worked as a research assistant at the University of Bremen on a project uncovering the legacy of colonialism in Africa.
