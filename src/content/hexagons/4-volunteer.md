I am a representative for young researchers at the [Mannheim Center for European Social Research (MZES)](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en), organizing a colloquium for non-faculty members or regular early-career events. Outside of work, I am engaged in local youth work, and I have also volunteered at CorrelAid, a data4good organization dedicated to making data analysis more accessible to the public sector.
