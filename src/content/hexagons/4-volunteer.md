I am a representative for junior scholars at the [Mannheim Center for European Social Research](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en), organizing a colloquium for non-faculty members or regular early-career-events. I am also the student representative for my cohort at the [Center for Doctoral Studies in Social and Behavioral Sciences](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gess/programs/cdss/). Outside of work, I am engaged in local youth work, and I have also volunteered at CorrelAid, a data4good organization dedicated to making data analysis more accessible to the public sector.
