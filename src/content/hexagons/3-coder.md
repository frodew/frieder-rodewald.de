I dove into web programming some years ago, first by creating [filmbegeistert.de](https://filmbegeistert.de) with HTML, CSS, and PHP. Later, I helped others create websites and learned to code in R and Python. Using Python, I could already automate some of my workflows. You can check out my [Github](https://github.com/FriederRodewald) page to find out more.
