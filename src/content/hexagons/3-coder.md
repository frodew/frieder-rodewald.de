I dove into web programming some years ago, first by creating [filmbegeistert.de](https://filmbegeistert.de) with HTML, CSS, and PHP. Later, I helped others create websites and learned to code in R and Python. Through using Linux I continued my journey and dove into automating workflows. You can check out my [Github](https://github.com/frodew) to find out more.
