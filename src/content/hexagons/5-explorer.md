I rarely have a day without a discovery. My love to learn and explore encompasses the useful and the not-so-useful: Automating a workflow that was bugging me, ricing my Fedora/Hyprland/Neovim/Kitty/... setup, learning new languages (currently Italian), improve my guitar and trumpet skills, or play with my custom self-build keyboard [fro-dux v1](https://github.com/frodew/fro-dux).
