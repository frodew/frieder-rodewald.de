*This section is aimed to present my latest (published) research. For now, I present my general research interests as I currently have several ongoing projects, but no publication :)*

My main interest lies in studying what people do online. Analyzing what we do on online platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, or LinkedIn helps us understand how people think and why they behave as they do. I specifically research to what extent people accurately report their online behavior and how they manage their privacy. Together with [Nina Osenbr√ºgge](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/en/people/detail/nina-osenbruegge), I also work to understand how passive content consumption impacts radicalisation on YouTube.

For most of my research, I rely on [data donation](https://github.com/frodew/workshop_spp_annual_meeting) as a method to collect people's online behavior. This innovative privacy-preserving collection method for digital trace data relies on the fact that people can request and download their information from any online platform with a couple of clicks. While that sound nice in principle, there are still many challenges to be tackled, and I'm part of that journey; particularly focusing on how we can [increase participation in data donation studies](https://osf.io/kuqsm) and [integrate it into large-scale infrastructure](https://data-donation-science.de/).
